Assuming that we have some email addresses in the 
"username@companyname.com" format, please write program to print the 
company name of a given email address. Both user names and company 
names are composed of letters only.
Example: If the following email address is given as input to the program:

Then, the output of the program should be:

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to 
be a console input

import re

email = "john@google.com elise@python.com"
pattern = "\w+@(\w+).com"
ans = re.findall(pattern,email)
print(ans)
