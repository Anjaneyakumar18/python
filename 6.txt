#Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the givenformula:Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]Following are the fixed values of C and H:C is 50. H is 30.D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a commaseparated sequence.For example Let us assume the following commaseparated input sequence is given to the program:100,150,180The output of the program should be:18,22,24





import math

C = 50
H = 30

# take comma-separated input sequence as a string and split it into a list of individual numbers
D_list = input("Enter comma-separated values of D: ").split(",")

# create an empty list to store the results
Q_list = []

# loop through each value of D in the list
for D in D_list:
    # calculate Q using the given formula
    Q = math.sqrt((2 * C * int(D))/H)
    # append Q to the list of results
    Q_list.append(round(Q))  # round off the result to the nearest integer

# print the list of results as comma-separated values
print(",".join(str(x) for x in Q_list))
