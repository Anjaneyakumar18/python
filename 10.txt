10. Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as 
input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting 
them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world


word = sorted(list(set(input().split())))              
                                                       
print(" ".join(word))
